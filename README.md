 ### Algorithm/ Library Used :- <br>
 1)  OpenCV 
 2)  PCA- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation which converts a set of correlated variables to a set of uncorrelated variables.
 3)  Logistic Regression - Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).  Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.
